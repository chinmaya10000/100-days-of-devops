# Story Blog

This repository contains a collection of short stories written collaboratively by Sarah and Max.

## Scenario / Problem

Max recently made some changes to the repository but was unable to push them because the remote repository already had new commits from Sarah.  
Additionally:  

- The `story-index.txt` file did not have all 4 story titles.  
- There was a typo in the story "The Lion and the Mooose" (`Mooose` should be `Mouse`).  

The task was to:  

1. Resolve the Git push issue by integrating remote changes.  
2. Ensure `story-index.txt` contains all 4 story titles.  
3. Correct the typo in "The Lion and the Mouse".  
4. Successfully push the corrected commits to the remote repository.

2. The Lion and the Mouse

## How the Issue Was Resolved

1. Pulled the latest changes from remote with rebase:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin master
   ```
   Resolved conflicts in story-index.txt by ensuring all 4 story titles were present and the typo was fixed.

2. Staged and continued the rebase:
   ```bash
   git add story-index.txt
   git rebase --continue
   ```

3. Pushed the updated commits to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

4. Verified the changes in Gitea UI and confirmed that:
   - All 4 story titles are present in `story-index.txt`.
   - The typo "Mooose" is corrected to "Mouse" in the relevant story file.
   - All changes have been successfully pushed and integrated.
