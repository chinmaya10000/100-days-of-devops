# 🚀 100 Days of DevOps — KodeKloud Challenge

A hands-on, implementation-focused DevOps journey documenting 100 consecutive days of practical labs, mini-projects, and real-world configuration exercises completed through KodeKloud.

This repository is a living journal of commands, configurations, and lessons learned while building CI/CD pipelines, containerized applications, Kubernetes deployments, cloud infrastructure, monitoring stacks, and DevSecOps practices.

## 📌 What this repository contains

For each of the 100 days you'll find a dedicated folder (Day-01 ... Day-100) containing:

- ✅ Concepts learned
- ✅ Commands & configuration files used
- ✅ Hands-on labs and step-by-step notes
- ✅ Real-world implementation tips and troubleshooting notes
- ✅ Mini projects, scripts and automation examples
