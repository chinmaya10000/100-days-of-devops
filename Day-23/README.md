# Nautilus Project Repository Fork

This task demonstrates how a new developer can fork an existing Git repository on the Gitea server for independent development.

## Task Objective

A new developer, **Jon**, needs to start working on a project by forking an existing repository:

- Original repository: `sarah/story-blog`
- Forked under user: `jon`

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Access Gitea UI**  
   - Click the Gitea UI button on the top bar or navigate to the Gitea URL.

2. **Login to Gitea**  
   - **Username:** `jon`  
   - **Password:** `Jon_pass123`  

3. **Locate the Repository**  
   - Search for `sarah/story-blog` in the Gitea interface.

4. **Fork the Repository**  
   - Click the **Fork** button.  
   - Ensure the fork is created under Jon’s account (`jon/story-blog`).

5. **Verify the Fork**  
   - Navigate to Jon’s profile and confirm the forked repository exists.  
   - Check branches and commits to ensure the fork matches the original.

## Screenshots / Documentation

- Take screenshots of:
  - Gitea login
  - Original repository page
  - Fork confirmation
  - Jon’s forked repository page
- Optionally, record the process using [loom.com](https://www.loom.com) for video documentation.

## Notes

- Forking allows independent development without affecting the original repository.  
- No command-line actions are required; this task is entirely UI-based.  
- Screenshots or video recording serve as proof of task completion.
